# Block

In the Witnet network protocol, a `block` is formatted as follows:

| Field       | Type              | Description                                                                                          |
| ----------- | :---------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `header`    | `block_header`    | The header of the block                                                                              |
| `txn_count` | `u32`             | The total number of transactions of the block                                                        |
| `txns`      | `[tx; txn_count]` | Block transactions following the format of a `TX` command, as described in the [Transaction] section |

A non-empty list of transactions is always provided because the coinbase transaction should always be included.

## Block header structure

The block header (`block_header`) is composed of the following fields:

| Field              | Type       | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | :--------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`          | `u32`      | The block version number indicating the block validation rules          |
| `beacon`           | `beacon`   | A checkpoint beacon for the epoch that this block is closing            |
| `hash_merkle_root` | `[u8; 32]` | A 256-bit hash based on all of the transactions committed to this block |
| `proof`            | `proof`    | A miner-provided proof of leadership                                    |

## Checkpoint beacon structure

The checkpoint beacon (`beacon`) is composed of the following fields:

| Field             | Type       | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | :--------: | --------------------------------------------- |
| `checkpoint`      | `u32`      | The serial number for an epoch                |
| `hash_prev_block` | `[u8; 32]` | The 256-bit hash of the previous block header |

## Proof of leadership structure

The proof of leadership (`proof`) is formatted as:

| Field       | Type        | Description                                                        |
| ----------- | :---------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `block_sig` | `signature` | An enveloped signature of the block header except the `proof` part |
| `influence` | `[u8; 32]`  | The miner influence as of last checkpoint                          |

Signature structures are defined in the [Signature] section.
