    <p><strong>witnet-rust</strong> is an open source implementation of the Witnet Decentralized Oracle Network protocol written in Rust.</p>
</div>

## Components
__witnet-rust__ implements many different components intended to work in the Witnet ecosystem:
- __[node]__: a fully validating and archival Witnet blockchain node.
- __[wallet]__: a separate server for managing Witnet keys and abstracting the complexity of creating transactions.
- __[crypto]__: library implementing all the crypto-related operations used by Witnet, including signatures, hash functions and verifiable random functions.
- __[rad]__: an interpreter for [RADON] scripts included in Witnet data requests.  
- __[storage]__: the convenient local storage solution used by `node` and `wallet`.
- __[p2p]__: modules for managing peer sessions and connections.
- __[data_structures]__: data structures common to all other components.
- __[validations]__: functions that validate Witnet protocol data structures.
- __[schemas]__: Protocol Buffer schemas for the Witnet protocol.

Members of the Witnet project also develop and maintain these other related Rust crates:
- __[protobuf-convert]__: macros for convenient serialization of Rust data structures into/from Protocol Buffers.
- __[async-jsonrpc-client]__: event-driven JSON-RPC client with support for multiple transports

## Current status

_DISCLAIMER: This is experimental software running on experimental network protocols. Be careful!_

- All the main components are in placeâ€”but they need yet to be battle tested before mainnet. 
- `Testnet-1` is live. [Here's the roadmap][roadmap] and this is [how to run a node].
- The Witnet community is doing its best to make `witnet-rust` rock solid as soon as possible.
- [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are more than welcome.

## Running / installing

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [installation guide][install].
